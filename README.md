# cyberbullying
This is a user-friendly React application designed to prevent cyberbullying, with animations implemented using GSAP.
The Cyberbullying Detection and Prevention Project is aimed at developing an intelligent system that can detect and prevent instances of cyberbullying on various online platforms. Cyberbullying has become a serious issue affecting individuals, especially children and teenagers, causing emotional distress and potential harm. This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify and mitigate cyberbullying incidents, thereby fostering a safer online environment.

## Features
- Real-time Monitoring: The system continuously monitors online platforms, such as social media networks and forums, to detect instances of cyberbullying as they occur.
- Text Analysis: Leveraging natural language processing techniques, the system analyzes text data to identify offensive, abusive, or threatening language commonly associated with cyberbullying.
- User Profiling: The system creates profiles of users involved in cyberbullying incidents, allowing for better understanding and tracking of their activities.
- Preventive Measures: The system provides recommendations and resources for individuals to prevent cyberbullying, including educational materials, reporting mechanisms, and mental health support.
